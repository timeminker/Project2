# Project2

# link to app:
https://agile-depths-63526.herokuapp.com/bkbikes/

# Utilized Express, Node, Mongo, and MongoDB to create app, including routes to different pages and with different functions - editing of items, creation of new items, and deletion. Also included related model to allow users to leave reviews for individual bikes. Also incorporated Google Maps API for location functionality of a physical store location.

# Approach taken:
Wanted to design an app that would allow users to interact with a database of bicycles, create new entries, edit and delete, as well as evaluate and review bikes. Decided to model after a bike shop page, and present the information as if to customers looking to educate themselves about bicycle information.

# Things that didn't work/to fix:
- unable to get secondary controller for reviews to work properly (and did not notice that this wasn't working until too late to fix). Is not populating fields into corresponding object.
- Google Maps page is a little fussy, and styling is very complicated as the code is highly specific to that application. Perhaps i-frame is the better use for this, with more limited functionality.
- Also had trouble styling the categories pages. Would like to have individual bikes displayed in rows instead of columns
